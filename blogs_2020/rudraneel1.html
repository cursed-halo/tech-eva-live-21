          Lately, a whole bunch of tech giants including the likes of Twitter, Facebook
          and Google have come under some serious fire from different governments all
          over the globe with allegations ranging from the usual accusations of privacy
          breaches to nefarious ploys of interfering in elections.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the last decade, these companies have grown exponentially to hitherto
        unimaginable magnitudes, and grow they still do, at ever faster rates, all while
        gobbling up any and all meaningful competition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, itâ€™s an open mystery as to how these tech monoliths seemingly get
        to simultaneously be the arbiters of their own brands of free speech while also
        enjoying the benefits that come from special laws designed to make them
        impervious to lawsuits and all scrutiny that comes from widespread abuse of
        anyone and everyone that dares to speak against the current hot topic, for
        constitutional rights be damned, we are supreme.

          A recent Twitter hack exposed glaring security flaws in twitterâ€™s internal
        system. While the perpetrators remain at large as of date, the echoes of the
        potential hazards posed by rogue entities within and without looms over the
        world.

          A recent Twitter hack exposed glaring security flaws in twitterâ€™s internal
        system. While the perpetrators remain at large as of date, the echoes of the
        potential hazards posed by rogue entities within and without looms over the
        world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hack, for what is known, while absolutely massive, was awfully simple for
        itâ€™s scale. The world is lucky that the hackers just made off with barely half a
        million in crypto - and quite possibly billions from the personal chats of some of
        the worldâ€™s richest and most powerful men and women, but hey, if the media
        wants you to believe otherwise, who are you, a lowly peasant to say otherwise.
        An alternate reality that couldâ€™ve quite possibly sprung out of this hack
        wouldâ€™ve been, say, a total stock market crash, or better yet, nuclear
        Armageddon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine waking up to see the total world credit system or stock market in
        disarray because random hackers broke in and sold all sorts of unsavory
        private messages, or maybe that actually did happen, and said hackers are
        tightly holding onto stockpiles of all sorts of secret messages as leverage for
        the highest bidder, which may as well be a three letter agency in the US waging
        war on another three letter agency; a little sibling rivalry, if you will.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, imagine waking up only to discover your ethereal remains
        floating above a world engulfed in hell fire all because some hackers thought
        itâ€™d be funny to mock a certain <s>un</s>stable Korean Dictator from a certain equally
        <s>un</s>stable US Presidentâ€™s Twitter - crap. This one actually happened. Without
        hackers. Well, at least itâ€™s grade A entertainment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elsewhere, in one of the unknown alleys of China, kids put together boots and
        suits for the millionaires and billionaires, who in turn preach to you, the lowly
        peasant that thou shalt buy their brand of over-the-top, awfully up-marked
        cosmetics and lifestyle goods or else youâ€™re just not woke enough and probably
        want to kill... hold on, furiously shuffles deck, &lt;insert perceived minority&gt;!.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, somewhere their masters in turn reenact Nazi Germany for the free
        slave labor laughs, but no one cares. For the <s>spice</s> money must flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dare you not question your media masters, for they are your benevolent
        guardians. Fret not, for all you need to do to achieve salvation is to consume.
        Consume and forget and believe, donâ€™t question, leave that to the experts, they
        know better anyways.
        </p>
        <p>
          Was the world, so wide, always this wild? Difficult to answer, for one genuinely
        would find it hard to argue for, as it would be an awfully malevolent take and
        too cynical to claim that the developments that have allowed for millions and
        billions of people all over the globe to escape from the jaws of desolate
        poverty, gain access to quality education and then some. Yet on the contrary,
        in pursuit of pure materialistic development, the world has lost track of the
        fundamental values that made us humans, we have seemingly lost all
        empathy, and live apathetic lives where the void can only be filled through
        more and more consumption, which, in turn, is also unquestionable. Our base
        needs and desires have all but been played up and down through algorithms
        and such to ensure that when you kneel over, some faceless monolith of a
        corporation can (and <i>will</i>) tally up <i>exactly</i> what you were worth, and the cycle
        will repeat, ad infinitum.
        </p>
        <p>
          We buy things we donâ€™t need with money we donâ€™t have and let the things that
        we own end up owning us.
        Such is the microcosm of our very own dystopia lite.
        </p>
