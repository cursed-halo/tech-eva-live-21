            <p>I was very curious since my childhood that how a human (named astrologer)can tell my future  by seeing the lines on my hand, how some stones can make a change in my life, how  it is possible to predict the future events by some theory. Later I came across the term ‚ÄúAstrology‚Äù, is a kind of pseudoscience that predicts  divine information about human affairs and terrestrial events by studying  the positions of  planets and the stars considered in their arbitrary combinations or configurations. Due to lots of curiosity I have  gone through some books based on Indian Astrology or well known as Vaidic Astrology.  Now I have a fair enough idea  about the process of prediction or how the so called astrologers do it. But  the twist happened in my vision  as soon as I started my journey in Machine Learning during my third semester .I became interested in machine learning because I found that, this subject  has a power of prediction through machine ,which was more acceptable for me.</p>

          <p>Basic concept of Machine learning  is to give a system the ability to  learn  automatically from provided data  and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. There  are a good number are algorithms in ML that helps us to predict any results.I am not getting into that. In this blog am trying to tell that how I  found these two fields correlated.  I think Indian Astrology is a very well built and trained Machine Learning Algorithm. It seems highly impossible for a comparison between two completely irrelevant topics. But they are not indifferent. In fact, both deal with prediction of an outcome based on inputs. In Machine Learning we train our learner with training data, to estimate as closely as possible the actual mapping function. Same is the case with Astrology where people with immense experience and knowledge came together and saw a pattern in the peoples‚Äô decision making, choice of work, IQ levels, Personality traits. Every set of data exhibits a pattern. In Machine learning, we call it clustering, which comes under unsupervised learning. Except that, the ancient people didn‚Äôt form clusters, but they realized that there exists a pattern in people with a similar set of initial variables, which is quite equivalent in logic to clustering. They used their experience of lifetime, where they saw many people and  grouped them. It could also well be the initial development of taxonomy. So, let us say we believe it as a fact that astrology is a machine learning algorithm, which we did show earlier, that it is very much possible. But our machine learning algorithms strive to predict a simple classification on the modern day‚Äôs organized data, then how does astrology do it? To put it in a line, it avoids over-fitting by reducing attributes and giving probabilistic outputs. </p>

        <div class="container__text">
          <p>Astrology tells us if a person lives till a certain period. It might not give a date, but an interval, which it predicts from father‚Äôs and mother‚Äôs family name, details of birth. Now, family name is a non-technical alias for a more scientific information, the genome. It could get information about average life expectancy for that family in general, and probable hereditary health conditions and all. This influences the life expectancy. Its equivalent to performing a logistic regression in Machine Learning. But only with more complicated data. It then analyses the correlations on training data and forms a model. This model is subject to continuous learning.</p>
          <p>Hence, I stick to my earlier words, predicting a small event which is highly unstable and hugely effected by even minuscule environmental factors can‚Äôt be predicted even by astrology.</p>
