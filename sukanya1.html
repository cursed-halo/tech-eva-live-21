                <p>Who hasn't dreamt of flying around in spaceships and living in a world of talking robots as a child? I clearly remember myself living in that reality quite often in my sleep. It was spectacular: a vision of the future shrouded in fantasy. Little did I know that in the few years that I grow up, the world would have advanced so fast that this fantasy could very well be brought to life.
                    I have always credited myself for having an active imagination, with my mind whirring constantly with new thoughts, and this, paired with my fascination for technology prompted me to do some research on exactly what I could expect the future to look like. In this blog post, I will be putting forth my understanding of the seemingly unbelievable reality that lies not for ahead. 
                    </p>
                <p><b>How is technology going to change the world in the next 30 years?</b></p> 
                <p>As engineers and as simply people living in this age of instantly available data, we have all come across certain terms, namely: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Internet of Things (IoT), etc. What are these technologies and how will their domestic implementation change our lives?</p>
                <p>To put it simply, the ability of machines to remember and learn from the data that they collect (machine learning) will make them intelligently able enough to take real-life decisions (artificial intelligence) such that they can become a substitute for human effort. At the same time, programming machines such that they let us experience simulation as though it were real (augmented reality) paired with their ability to entirely immerse us in a world of digital creations (virtual reality) will change how we experience everything in our day-to-day lives. Finally, connecting the world together in the truest sense with all appliances sharing data (Internet of Things) will make controlling our lives much easier and it will also let robots navigate the world better. </p>
                <p>This is a rough summary of the future that lies ahead but what will it look like for real? Read on to find out a few ways that technology is going to startle you!</p>

            <p><b>HUMAN-LIKE ROBOTS </b></p>
            <p>Robots have been around for quite some time but as we go deeper with our implementation of artificial intelligence, these will take on more and more human characteristics. It may be predicted that by 2030, robots will have developed consciousness. This means that they will be aware of the reality they exist in and therefore will be able to take decisions accordingly (a frightening possibility for me, personally). </p>
            <p><b>ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT HOMES </b></p>  
            <p>Very soon, buildings will have built-in AI which will allow you to talk to your house and command it to adjust to your needs. For example, it would be able to dim the lights, change the temperature, etc. Going hand-in-hand with this will be the use of robots at home as house help and for companionship. (Cue: imagine a robotic dog that plays with you and fetches things for you!) </p>
            <p><b>SKYSCRAPER CITIES </b></p>
            <p>With the advent of IoT, managing spaces and communities will become easier. In this scenario, autonomous cities will see a rise. This paired with the shortage of space will see super-tall buildings being made into cities with integrated offices, gyms, residential areas, administrative bodies and a synced ecosystem. This will radically increase the usage of drones for delivery as now, carrying packages will require vertical movement. </p>

            <p><b>MATRIX-LIKE WORLD </b></p>
            <p>Soon enough, our entire experience of reality will become digital. Classrooms will reject textbooks and employ VR systems to help students visualize better. By as early as 2025, smartphones will become obsolete, being replaced by bracelets or spectacles that project a simulation which looks like a phone screen. With the help of nanotechnology, our brains will be able to draw data from computers to live in a world that is completely digitally constructed. </p>
            <p><b>HUMAN CYBORGS </b></p>
            <p>Prosthetics that give humans superpowers or skills aren't far away. The advancement in technology is so rapid that humans will soon become comfortable with technology merging with their bodies. For example, people can choose to have implants in their legs to make them stronger. We already have accounts such as these, for example, a French artist uses an artificial arm which has a built-in tattoo gun. Clothing and suits will also come around which gives us enhanced abilities, e.g., Hyundai's exoskeleton which lets you lift heavy weights. Human minds will be enhanced with machines we are not far from being half-human, half-machine. </p>
